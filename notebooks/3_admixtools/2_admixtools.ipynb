    "The software commonly used in the ancient DNA field. It can calculate D-statistics, f-statistics, admixturegraphs, and other things.\n",

    "The basic software is openly available here:\n",

    "Since it is a pain to use for non-bioinformaticians (and often even for them), there is an R package to work flexibly with it:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is what we will use, installation takes some time, that's why I asked you to do that first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you see a common tradeoff: to make things easier, you may need to go through a laborious step. Once you completed it, tasks become easier, but you need to do the initial step to get going.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using an R package is that R is widely used not only in bioinformatics but also statistics, very versatile, and some of you may have used it before.\n",
    "\n",
    "## While the installation may still run, we get a quick intro to R!\n",
    "\n",
    "For that, open a new tab with a terminal, or use RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "RStudio only if you are an experienced used with that. The Terminal is easier because we can split the screen."
