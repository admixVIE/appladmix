    "The program [ADMIXTURE](https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/) is a widely used tool to estimate proportional ancestries from SNP data. Read more about it [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.094052.109). The funny thing is that his program does not actually detect admixture, but clusters SNPs based on shared occurrence across samples. The reason why they are shared can be various, including admixture, but also simply shared ancestry, bottlenecks, or other events in the history of the populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, it is often used to understand how individuals/populations relate to each other, or more specifically how many clusters of individuals are there in the population based on their majority ancestry. For example, there might be three population clusters in bonobos, as shown in panel B of this from a [publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.09.043) on whole genome data from this species:\n",
